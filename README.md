## 2D Side scroller Octopus Game
My game idea is a 2D side scroller game where you play as an octopus who's injured himself and is having to drag himself along the ocean floor. The aim of the game is to reach the end of the levels with the levels getting progressively harder the further you go. You will have to destroy obstacles such as coral reefs and jump over dangerous rocks while fending off viscous fish who want to eat you and you'll have to be on the look for treasure which gets you points, you can also find health power-ups along the way (may be more power-ups added). As the levels get harder there will be more obstacles as well as fish attacking you. 

## Core Game Mechanics
    . Moving through the level to complete it
    . Jump over rocks
    . Shooting ink at enemies and obsticles to destroy them
    . Aim is to get to end of level
    . As levels progress more obstacles and bad fish making it harder
    . Health system where if you hit 4 obstacles or 4 enemies you die unless you collect a health powerup
    . When you die screen will ink up and display score
    . Point leader board system to see who has collected most treasure

## Controller Idea
The controller idea I have in mind is very simple so anyone can grasp how to use it, it will be in the shape of the octopus character in the game and will feature a joystick and a button to shoot ink. This will make it very easy and hopefully addictive for a wide range of audiences. I want it so anyone can grab it and play the game. I'm going for the simple controller because I want a retro and simplistic feel to my game.

## Inspiration

Liked the basic idea of a 2D game as I'll have to make the art myself as well as the idea of the ship being the player you play in the game so the controller is the character. I took this design and modified it and that'a when I thought of my octopus idea. I really liked the simplistic feel of the controller and how easy it made the game to play.

Same with this game as the controller is basically what you play as in the game. Also again yet a very simplistic and easy game to play which appeals to lots of people.

Atari 2600
Simple joystick and button, very well known controller, easy to grasp. This is the original button and joystick controller (that I could find anyway) which has done very well inspiring probably hundreds of other controller out there. With 1 button and a joystick it's very easy to grasp for people of all ages and games can tend to be quite simplistic on it.

## Market Research
From what I've researched into I sturggled to find any 2D side scrollers with a unique custom controller where the controller is the same as the character. However the simplistic controller with a joystick and a button have been around for a long time the first example I could find was the Atari 2600 which was highly successful and sold millions of units worldwide. To this day today they still make remakes which can plug into your TV and play a wide range of games on. People still like the retro feel and love to show their kids what they used to have. 2D side scrollers are popular games even to this day with the most well known one being Mario which is almost a house hold name. 

## Revised Controller
Made my controller revisions before. My original controller idea was the controller still being in the shape of the octopus however I wanted 7/8 buttons, one for each lef of the octopus with each having a different function. I realised this was a bad idea as 7/8 buttons would have been hard to play on and I didn't have enough functions for them so I simplified my idea to a joystick for movement and a button to shoot ink making it easy to play.
