## 2D Side scroller Octopus Game
My game idea is a 2D side scroller game where you play as an octopus swimming through the ocean. The aim of the game is to reach the end of the levels with the levels getting progressively harder the further you go. You will have to dodge obsticles while fending off viscious fish and you'll have to be on the look for treasure which gets you points, you can also find health power-ups along the way (may be more power-ups added). As the levels get harder there will be more obsticles as well as fish attacking you. 

## Core Game Mechanics
# . Moving around the screen to dodge obsticles
# . Slapping your tentacles at other fish
# . Grabbing treasure with other tenticles
# . As levels progress more obsitcles and bad fish making it harder
# . Point leaderboard system to see who has collected most treasure
