## 2D Side scroller Octopus Game
My game idea is a 2D side scroller game where you play as an octopus who's injured himself and is having to drag himself along the ocean floor. The aim of the game is to reach the end of the levels with the levels getting progressively harder the further you go. You will have to dodge obstacles such as coral reefs and objects floating through the ocean, while fending off viscous fish who want to eat you and you'll have to be on the look for treasure which gets you points, you can also find health power-ups along the way (may be more power-ups added). As the levels get harder there will be more obstacles as well as fish attacking you. 

## Core Game Mechanics
    . Moving around the screen to dodge obstacles
    . Slapping your tentacles at other fish or crush them with your tentacles
    . Grabbing treasure with other tentacles
    . As levels progress more obstacles and bad fish making it harder
    . Health system where if you hit 3 obstacles or 3 enemies you die unless you collect a health powerup
    . When you die screen will ink up and display score
    . Point leader board system to see who has collected most treasure

## Controller Idea
The controller will be in the shape of an octopus with each pair of legs being able to do a different function. The functions I have in mind so far are two pairs of legs to move you up and down the screen and left and right, another pair to slap away the fish in a pinball like motion, another pair for picking up treasure. Since he's injured I think I could get away with only having 6 or 7 functions since in the sprites he has a bandaged leg. Alternatively I was thinking of having a joystick for the basic movement functions.

## Inspiration
http://shakethatbutton.com/spacebattleship-shield/
Liked the basic idea of a 2D game as I'll have to make the art myself as well as the idea of the ship being the player you play in the game so the controller is the character. I took this design and modified it into my octopus idea.
