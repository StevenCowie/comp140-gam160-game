## 2D Side scroller Octopus Game
My game idea is a 2D side scroller game where you play as an octopus swimming through the ocean. The aim of the game is to reach the end of the levels with the levels getting progressively harder the further you go. You will have to dodge obsticles such as coral reefs and objects floating through the ocean, while fending off viscious fish who want to eat you and you'll have to be on the look for treasure which gets you points, you can also find health power-ups along the way (may be more power-ups added). As the levels get harder there will be more obsticles as well as fish attacking you. 

## Core Game Mechanics
    . Moving around the screen to dodge obsticles
    . Slapping your tentacles at other fish
    . Grabbing treasure with other tenticles
    . As levels progress more obsitcles and bad fish making it harder
    . Health system where if you hit 3 obsticles or 3 enemies you die unless you collect a health powerup
    . When you die screen will ink up and display score
    . Point leaderboard system to see who has collected most treasure

## Controller Idea
The controller will be in the shape of an octopus with each pair of legs being able to do a different function. The functions I have in mind so far are a pair of legs to move you up and down the screen, another pair to slap away the fish in a pinball like motion, another pair for picking up treasure and potentially the last pair to move you to the right and left of the screen or potentially I might have like a scroll wheel for that. I'm still currently thinking of what else I could use the last pair of tenticles for.

## Inspiration
http://shakethatbutton.com/spacebattleship-shield/
Liked the basic idea of a 2D game as I'll have to make the art myself as well as the idea of the ship being the player you play in the game so its easxctly what the player sees. I took this design and modified it into my ocotpus idea.
